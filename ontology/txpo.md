Elucidating the mechanism of toxicity is crucial in drug safety evaluations. We focus on toxic processes and developed a toxic process ontology, designated TXPO.
The TXPO contains an is-a hierarchy that is organized into three layers: the top layer contains general terms, mostly derived from the Basic Formal Ontology. The intermediate layer contains biomedical terms in OBO foundry, and the lower layer contains toxicological terms.
